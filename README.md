# Time Tracker

Web app which uses Server-side rendering (SSR) with the help of Next.js and Express,
and React for Single Page Application (SPA) functionality.

Track time on tasks and projects with this web app.

Uses styled-jsx so CSS is scoped to the desired elements.

`npm run dev` - for development, hot module replacement.

`npm run build` - to build it ready for production, has performance boost.

`npm start` - to run the built production version.
